This Flight Route Planner is a powerful tool designed to model and optimize air travel networks using a graph-based structure. Airports are represented as nodes, and flight routes are edges with associated travel times. Users can add airports and bidirectional flight routes, ensuring data integrity by validating inputs like airport existence and positive flight times. The system’s core feature is finding the fastest route between two airports using **Dijkstra's algorithm**, which employs a **min-heap** to efficiently prioritize the shortest paths. Once the optimal route is calculated, the system reconstructs and displays the path, including the sequence of airports and total travel time. Additionally, users can visualize the entire flight network, with all airports and their direct connections clearly listed.
